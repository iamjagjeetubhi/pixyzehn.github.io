This is the first week article. I inspired by many news letters.
Sometimes I wanted to wrap up articles I read about Swift and iOS. This series of articles will be posted in every week:)
I try to do my best to achieve that.
I'll add `#swiftyweek` tag to this series of articles.

There are some notes in the Swifty Week.  

- At least, this is a just memo for me.  
- I may use an incorrect English. (If you find my mistake, please let me know.)
- I usually post on weekends.  
- I put about 10 ~ 15 links with a short comment at most.
- Subtitles are `Article`, `Github`, `Random` and so on.

I manage the all posts in [Github](https://github.com/pixyzehn/pixyzehn.github.io/tree/master/_posts){:target="_blank"}. Please create a PR or an issue if you want any changes.

### Article

#### [Protocol Oriented Programming is Not a Silver Bullet](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/protocol-oriented-programming/){:target="_blank"}

> protocols are just one way to achieve polymorphic code

I cannot abuse Protocol Oriented Programming in everywhere.

<br>

#### [dotSwift 2016 - Rob Napier - Beyond Crusty: Real-World Protocols](https://youtu.be/QCxkaTj7QJs){:target="_blank"}

@chriseidhof recommend the video at the end of `Protocol Oriented Programming is Not a Silver Bullet`. This talk is useful if you think about when should I use Protocol Oriented Programming.

<br>

#### [Protocol-oriented Programming in Swift - Apple WWDC 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2LwFZatfTI){:target="_blank"}

It may be time to watch the famous video again.

<br>

#### [Functional programming with Swift 3](http://mislavjavor.github.io/2016/11/14/Functional-programming-with-Swift-3.html){:target="_blank"}

If you don't know about the side of functional in Swift, this is the simple and clear article. You can check all in Swift Playground.

<br>

#### [Meaningful Composite Errors](https://medium.com/@IanKeen/meaningful-composite-errors-3146f191ff28#.nd9kwx9jz){:target="_blank"}

Error handling is really important in Swift. He explain how to handle error by using a simple JSON decode case like a [Himotoki](https://github.com/ikesyo/Himotoki){:target="_blank"}. (just interface.)

<br>

#### [Fun with Set](http://commandshift.co.uk/blog/2016/11/25/fun-with-sets/){:target="_blank"}

> This behaviour is reversed in Swift 3. Members of the first set are kept when performing a union operation. This means that most of the specific mappings are dropped when performing the union, because there is often a default mapping with the same name.

A behavior in Set is reversed in between Swift 2.2 and Swift 3. It looks weird for me. The article make me dig into the reason.(Not yet.)

<br>

#### [Fun with Date Calculations](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/fun-with-date-calculations/){:target="_blank"}

This is another `fun with ***` series. But author is different.

<br>

#### [noescape + Swift](https://medium.com/the-traveled-ios-developers-guide/noescape-swift-93375ba9d6c8#.6d0ckuvqw){:target="_blank"}

`@noescape` is the default value. We just need to add `@escape` if needed. Very simple. That's make sense.

<br>

#### [Swift 4 roadmap](https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/10/swift-4-roadmap){:target="_blank"}

> Expected to be released in late 2017, Swift 4 will aim to stabilize the language, both at the source code and ABI level. New features will include improvements to generics, and a Rust/Cyclone-inspired memory ownership model.

Looks good and promising. I hope Swift evolve constantly in the future.

### Github

[nicklockwood/SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)  

> A code library and command-line formatting tool for reformatting Swift code

[cookiecutter-swift/Framework](https://github.com/cookiecutter-swift/Framework)  

> A template for new Swift iOS / tvOS / watchOS / macOS Framework project ready with travis-ci, cocoapods, Carthage, SwiftPM and a Readme file

I really like useful command-line tool. Both tools will save a lot of my development time.
