This is the **#10** article. Today, I released a new simple app called [Kigen(期限): Todo List for reminder](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/kigen-todo-list-for-reminder/id1198205732?l=en&mt=8). The main porpose is to learn MVVM pattern with Realm, so don't expect awesome application:(  
But I really like creating a simple and minimum app because I can focus on a quality of code and a technical problem.
