I'm Hiroki Nagasawa and I live in Chiba (next to Tokyo), Japan. Thank you for visiting this site. I mostly develop iOS apps, libraries, and tools. My motto is to create something that fills people all over the world with great :Delight. I'll write about tips that I wanted to share once in a while.
If you have any question or feedback, feel free to contact me. The origin of my account name "pixyzehn" is [Dragan Stojkovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi%C4%87). He was my superstar in football when I was a child. 

<hr>

I like taking photos with iPhone or RICOH GR everywhere especially in the mountain. You can take a look at my photos in [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pixyzehn/). I have put my favorite [links](../links) just for myself. I like trekking or hiking in my free time. This is the [mountain lists](../mountain) that I climbed.

Feel free to say hi :+1:
