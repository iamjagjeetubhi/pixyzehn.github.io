I'm Hiroki Nagasawa and I live in Tokyo, Japan. Thank you for visiting this site. I mostly develop iOS apps, libraries and tools. My motto is to create something that fill people all over the world with great :Delight. I'll write about tips that I wanted to share once in a while.
If you have any question or feedback, feel free to contact me. The origin of my account name "pixyzehn" is [Dragan Stojkovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Stojkovi%C4%87). He was my superstar in football when I was a child.

I like taking photos with iPhone or RICOH GR everywhere and use flickr as an image hosting. Here are [my photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pixyzehn/albums) and [Instgram](https://www.instagram.com/pixyzehn/). I have put my favorite [links](../links) just for myself.

Feel free to say hi :+1:
